ProblemCODE : BINARYSTROP
Difficulty : Medium
Marks : 15

Given two binary numbers in form of strings and
a string representing "AND", "OR", "NOR" or "XOR". Return the output string which forms by doing the specified operation on those 2 strings .


Ex:	Input: "101", "111", op =  "OR"
Output: "111"


Ex:	Input: "10101", "1111", op =  "AND"
Output: "00101"

Ex:	Input: "0111", "1010", op =  "XOR"
Output: "0010"

Ex:	Input: "0011", "1010", op =  "NOR"
Output: "0100"

Note :
In the above representations ,Write those strings on a paper ,you will understand them better . [Align them to the Right]
If 1 string length is less than other ,you need to consider missing letters as 0's ie "1111" AND "1" is same as "1111" AND "0001".
Ie if a String is "" ,you should consider it as All 0's .This dosent not apply if String is NULL.

For NOR : http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/2-Input-NOR-Gate-Truth-Table.jpg

Contraints :
String length < 50.
For 50% of TestCases ,only AND/OR operations will be given .
